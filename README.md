The vised_marks extension for EEGLAB adds editing functions to the native eegplot 
data scrolling figure. Specifically, it allows adding/editing event markers, flagging 
channels/components, flagging time periods and displaying the 
properties of the marks structure. This extension provides an interface and "marks" 
data structure for managing the flagging of channels/components and time periods.
This extension also provides tools for epoching the data for artifact 
detection then concatenating the data back into a continuous form while storing the 
rejection information in the "marks" structure.
